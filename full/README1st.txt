The Game Data
-------------

Digital Eel have graciously provided permission to redistribute the original

macOS Specific Notes
--------------------

Mod installation works differently on macOS vs Linux and Windows.

Because it's not normal to have sidecar data with a mac Application Bundle, and
you cannot add files to the bundle without breaking the signature, we keep the
mods in your Application Support folder along with the saves.

In order to install mods, you should run SAIS and exit, which will create the
correct folder in Application Support, and then copy the mods folder from the
distribution into your "~/Library/Application Support/SAIS" folder.  Additional
mods can be installed into that folder.
